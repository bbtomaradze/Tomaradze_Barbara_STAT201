# R indexing starts at 1 but the substr() function treats any start < 1 as 1
# and includes the end character
```{r}
string <- "Hello"
substr(string, 0, 1)
```

# Counts how many t's are in "statistics"
```{r}
subject <- "statistics"
count <- 0
for (i in 1:nchar(subject)){
  if (substr(subject, i, i) == "t") count <- count + 1
}
print(count)
```

# Substr() + toupper()
```{r}
toupper(substr("abcdef", 2, 4))
```

# Counts how many t's are in "getting a tattoo"
```{r}
status <- "Getting a tattoo"
count <- sum(strsplit(status, "")[[1]] == "t")
print(count)
```

# paste() returns a character vector, while cat() prints to the console but returns NULL
# paste() is used when you want to build a string for later use or assignment
# cat() is useful when you want nicely formatted, inline output without quotes

# split() is equivalent to strsplit() in R
